# Card-Game---War
Worked On this project while bored on an airplane for a couple hours - Ran into some bugs - It's not finished

Deck Class - Run the main in Deck.Java to generate a deck of cards in (value, suit) format and shuffle them

Userinput Example - Just prompts user if they want to play one or two players

War.Java - Runs the game - there is an error here that I have to fix. Basically it s supposed to execute the game of war]
I
 look foward to working on this more!
